ABOUT PROJECT : 
This is a static replica (without functionality) of Instagram and despite being static page you'll almost get the actual Instagram experience from the UI.
As HTML and CSS are building blocks of UI of any website, purpose of this project was to demonstrate the functionality and application of HTML5 & CSS3 by creating 
the replica of UI of popular social media platform Instagram.
**In this Project u'll get to see the home page of instagram with multiple post, stories, all non-functional navigations and buttons. You can scroll down to the last                 post and slide right to the last story.**
