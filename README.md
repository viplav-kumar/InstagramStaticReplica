# Instagram Static Replica
ABOUT PROJECT : 

This is a static replica (without functionality) of Instagram and despite being static page you'll almost get the actual Instagram experience from the UI.
As HTML and CSS are building blocks of UI of any website, purpose of this project was to demonstrate the functionality and application of HTML5 & CSS3 by creating 
the replica of UI of popular social media platform Instagram.

In this Project you'll get to see the home page of Instagram with multiple post, stories, all non-functional navigations and buttons except messenger button on home page, back button on chat/messenger page, home button and like button of each post which are functional. You can scroll down to the last post, slide right to the last story, navigate to messenger/chat-box page on clicking to messenger icon on home page (at top right corner), navigate back to home page on clicking to left arrow on chat-box/messenger page (at top left corner) and like each post by clicking on like button of each post or by double click on each post and experience the increment in likes count and even dislike the post by again clicking on like button.
